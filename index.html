  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics
  at the University of Washington, advised by Adrian E. Raftery and Carlos Cinelli. I am on the job market for the 2024--2025 academic year. 
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
  I am interested in developing Bayesian methods to tackle problems in: 
  <ul>
    <li>causal inference</li>
    <li>model selection and hypothesis testing</li>
    <li>nonparametric and high-dimensional statistics</li>
    <li>design and analysis of experiments</li>
    <li>modeling of complex data (e.g., mechanistic and infectious disease models)</li>
  </ul>
  My work is often motivated by applications in the health and social sciences.
